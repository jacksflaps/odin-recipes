# odin-recipes

I will be creating a website that displays different recipes. In doing this I will gain a better understanding for HTML syntax and the nature of the langauge. I will also learn my prefernces in how I structure my websites.

I've worked with HTML and CSS for the entirety of my high school career. This website (I will admit) is not my best work but it's functional and somewhat pleasing to look at. I will say however this project has taught me some things in CSS that I didn't realize was possible. I never knew how to use flexboxes before and footers always never worked for me so I have learned a lot.
